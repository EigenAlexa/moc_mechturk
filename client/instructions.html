	<p>For each game, you will be randomly matched with 4 other players and play the game with these players.  The goal of all players is to guess the number of heads in 100 new flips of this coin.</p>

	<p>We will first flip the coin 5 times and these flips will be observed by all players.</p>

	<p>Then, for you only, we will flip the coin 5 times, and you (and no other player) will see the outcome of these 5 flips.  We will do the same for every other player.</p>
