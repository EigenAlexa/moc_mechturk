	<p>For each game, you will be randomly matched with 4 other players and play the game with these players.  The goal of all players is to guess the number of heads in 100 new flips of this coin.</p>

	<p>We will first flip the coin 5 times and these flips will be observed by all players.</p>

	<p>Then, for you only, we will flip the coin 5 times, and you (and no other player) will see the outcome of these 5 flips.  We will do the same for every other player.</p>

		Once all players have seen their flips, you will have 30 seconds to submit a guess of the number of heads in 100 new flips of this coin.  After that, all the players' guesses will be revealed and you will have another 30 seconds to revise your guess.
