        You will play a series of guessing games with several other players. 
    </p>
</template>

<template name="tut_biased_coin">
    <p>
        In each game, you are given a biased coin, which is tilted in favor of coming up either heads or tails.  Its chance of coming up heads could be anything between 1% and 99%.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For example, if the coin has a 30% chance of coming up heads, then roughly, you expect to see 30 heads in 100 new flips of the coin.
    </p>

<template name="tut_goal">

        Your <b>goal</b> is to <b>guess the number of heads in 100 new flips of the biased coin</b>.
