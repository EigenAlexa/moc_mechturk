<template name="tut_overview">
    <p>
        In this experiment, our goal is to understand how to make use of the wisdom of the crowd to produce an accurate estimate of some quantity.
    </p>
</template>

<template name="tut_player">
    <p>
        You will play 20 betting games.  You will play each game with 4 other players randomly chosen from all participating players. 
    </p>
</template>

<template name="tut_biased_coin">
    <p>
        In each game, you will be shown a biased coin.  It is tilted in favor of coming up either heads or tails.  Its chance of coming up heads could be anything between 1% and 99%.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For example, if the coin has a 30% chance of coming up heads, then roughly, you expect to see 30 heads in 100 new flips of the coin.
    </p>

</template>

<template name="tut_goal">
    <p>
        Your goal is to guess the number of heads in 100 new flips of the coin.  You will earn a bonus payment based on the accuracy of your guess and possibly other players' guesses.
    </p>  

</template>

<template name="tut_info">
    <p>
        To help you make an accurate guess, you will see some coin flips.

        Some flips are observed by all players, whereas other flips are only observed by a particular player.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is an example.

        First, we will flip the coin 5 times, and all players observe the outcome of these flips.

        Each player will see an additional 5 coin flips.  These private flips are only seen by that player and not by anyone else.

        You will have 1 minute to submit your guess.

        There are 2 rounds of this game.

    <p>
        In round 1, you will have 30 seconds to submit your guess.  Once all players have submitted their guesses, round 1 ends and we will reveal all guesses.  
    </p>  
    <p>
        In round 2, you will have another 30 seconds to revise and submit your final guess.  Once all players have submitted their final guesses, the game ends and we will show you all final guesses and your bonus payment.

<template name="instIndiv">
    <h2>Individual Incentive</h2>
    <p>
        Your bonus payment will depend on the accuracy of your guess.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specifically, it will depend on the absolute difference between your guess and the number of heads in the 100 coin flips.  The smaller the difference, the higher your bonus payment.  If the difference is too large, you will receive no bonus payment.
    </p>
</template>

<template name="instComp">
    <h2>Competitive Incentive</h2>
    <p>
        You will <b>compete</b> with the other players for a bonus payment of $1.50.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will compare all players' guesses to the number of heads of the 100 coin flips.  The player who submitted the closest guess will receive the bonus payment.  If multiple guesses are closest, the players will split the bonus payment.  All other players will receive no bonus payment.
    </p>
</template>

<template name="instColl">
    <h2>Collaborative Incentive</h2>
    <p>
        Every player will be paid the same bonus payment.  This bonus payment will depend on the accuracy of the average of all players' guesses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specifically, the bonus payment will depend on the absolute difference between the average guess and the number of heads of the 100 coin flips.  The smaller the difference, the higher everyone's  bonus payment.  If the difference is too large, you will receive no bonus payment.
