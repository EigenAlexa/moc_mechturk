        In each game, you are given a biased coin, which is tilted in favor of coming up either heads or tails.  Its chance of coming up heads could be anything between 1% and 99%.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For example, if the coin has a 30% chance of coming up heads, then roughly, you expect to see 30 heads in 100 new flips of the coin.
    </p>

        Suppose that a coin has 40% chance of coming up heads.  If you flip the coin 100 times, which statement is true?
