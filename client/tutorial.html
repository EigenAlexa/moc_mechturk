    <p>
        In each game, you will be shown a biased coin.  It is tilted in favor of coming up either heads or tails.  Its chance of coming up heads could be anything between 1% and 99%.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For example, if the coin has a 30% chance of coming up heads, then roughly, you expect to see 30 heads in 100 new flips of the coin.

    <p>
        Your goal is to guess the number of heads in 100 new flips of the coin.  You will earn a bonus payment based on the accuracy of your guess and possibly other players' guesses.

    <p>
        To help you make an accurate guess, you will see some coin flips.

        Some flips are observed by all players, whereas other flips are only observed by a particular player.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider this example.

        First, we will flip the coin 5 times, and all players observe the outcome of these flips.

        Each player will see an additional 5 coin flips.  These private flips are only seen by that player and not by anyone else.
